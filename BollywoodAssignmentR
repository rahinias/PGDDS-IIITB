R Assignment - Insights about Bollywood movies released in 2016 using R

 
#	Import the Bollywood data set in Rstudio in a variable named bollywood

# Set the working directory
setwd("C:/Masters/PGDDS/001 R Programming/Working Directory")
bollywood <- read.csv("bollywood.csv")        
View(bollywood)


#	When you import a data set, R stores character vectors as factors (by default)
# You can check the structure of the data frame by using str()
  str(bollywood)

# You can change the attribute 'Movie' from factor to character type using the given command
  bollywood$Movie <- as.character(bollywood$Movie)
	 

#Q1.
#	Access the last 10 movies (from the bottom of the Bollywood data frame) using column bollywood$Movie
# Store the names of those movies in last_10 vector (in the same order)
     
	last_10 <- tail(bollywood[1],10) 
	# last_10 <- tail(bollywood$movies,10) command also can be used but the earlier command gives results in a structured format
	 
	  
#Q2.
#	Find out the total number of  missing values (NA) in the bollywood data frame.
# Store the result in na_bollywood vector
     
	sum(is.na(bollywood)) # returns 3 indicating 3 NAs in bollywood dataframe
	na_bollywood <- c(is.na(bollywood))  # this stores the result of is.na(bollywood) as vector in na_bollywood.
	# to store the value 3 as vector, na_bollywood <- c(sum(is.na(bollywood))) can be used
	  
	
#Q3
#	Write the command to find out which movie tops the list in terms of Total Collections
# Store the movie name in variable named top_movie
 
	#sapply(bollywood,class) Tcollection is Numeric , max functions can be applied
	#bollywood[order(bollywood[7],decreasing = TRUE)[1],1] also can be used
  top_movie <- bollywood[which.max(bollywood$Tcollection),1]
  
#Q4
#	Write the command to find out which movie comes second on the list in terms of Total Collections
# Store the movie name in variable named top_2_movie

  top_2_movie <- bollywood[order(bollywood[7],decreasing = TRUE)[2],1]
	  
	
# Now let's find out the movies shot by Shahrukh, Akshay and Amitabh separately.
# subset() function is used for that. The code has already been written for you. 
	
	shahrukh <- subset(bollywood, Lead == "Shahrukh")
	akshay <- subset(bollywood, Lead == "Akshay")
	amitabh <- subset(bollywood, Lead  == "Amitabh")

# You can view what the above data frames look like

		   
#Q5
#	What is the total collection of Shahrukh, Akshay and Amitabh movies individually?
# You can use	a column named 'Tcollection' for this 
 
  shahrukh_collection <- sum(shahrukh["Tcollection"]) #sum(shahrukh$Tcollection) also can be used
    
	akshay_collection <- sum(akshay["Tcollection"]) #sum(akshay$Tcollection) also can be used
    
	amitabh_collection <- sum(amitabh["Tcollection"]) #sum(amitabh$Tcollection) also can be used
    
	
#Q6  
# Write command/s to find out how many movies are in Flop, Average, Hit and Superhit categories in the entire Bollywood data set.

	summary(bollywood$Verdict) 	#returns Average 17, Flop 30, Hit 7 and Super Hit 7
   
#You can use SAPPLY function if you want to apply a function specific columns in a data frame 
#You can write a command to find the maximum value of Ocollection, Wcollection, Fwcollecion and Tcollection using sapply
  
	sapply(bollywood[1,1],function(x) bollywood$Movie[which.max(bollywood$Ocollection)])
	sapply(bollywood[1,1],function(x) bollywood$Movie[which.max(bollywood$Wcollection)])
	sapply(bollywood[1,1],function(x) bollywood$Movie[which.max(bollywood$Fwcollection)])
	sapply(bollywood[1,1],function(x) bollywood$Movie[which.max(bollywood$Tcollection)])
	
	
#Q7 
# Write a command to find the names of the movies which have the maximum Ocollection, Wcollection, Fwcollecion & Tcollection
# Store the names of 4 movies in same sequence in movie_result vector
	

# Two methods added based on how the question is understood.
	
sapply(bollywood[,c(4:7)],function(x) bollywood$Movie[which.max(x)])
	# result is 
#	Ocollection  Wcollection Fwcollection  Tcollection 
#	Sultan       Sultan       Sultan       Dangal 
	
#Another way is to find Individually and using Rbind, add these to the movie_result vector
	movie_result <- c(bollywood[which.max(bollywood$Ocollection),1])
	movie_result <- c(rbind(movie_result,bollywood[which.max(bollywood$Wcollection),1]))
	movie_result <- c(rbind(movie_result,bollywood[which.max(bollywood$Fwcollecion),1]))
	movie_result <- c(rbind(movie_result,bollywood[which.max(bollywood$Tcollection),1]))
#"Sultan" "Dangal" "Sultan" "Dangal"
    

#Unable to apply multiple column sort on Data frame to identify top 4 and extract. Currently exploring this option too
